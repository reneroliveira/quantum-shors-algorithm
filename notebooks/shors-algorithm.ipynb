    "Let $G_N$ be the set of all positive integers less than N, that are coprimes with N. One can show that this is a group under modulo-$N$ multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 chooses a random $a\\in \\mathbb{Z}_N$, if we are lucky to choose an $a$ which share factors with $N$, we just use Euclidean Algorithm for $\\gcd(N,a)$ and finish the factoring process.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in most cases we'll choose a number in $G_N$. Step 2 finds the order $r$ of $a$ in $G_N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we calculate $x=a^{r/2}~(mod~N)$ (step 3 garantees $r$ is even), and open up the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    (x-1)(x+1)&\\equiv x^2-1~(mod ~N)\\\\\n",
    "    &\\equiv a^r-1~(mod ~N)\\\\\n",
    "    &\\equiv 0 ~(mod ~N),\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "since $a^r\\equiv1~(mod~N)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $x-1\\not\\equiv 0 ~(mod ~N)$, because $r$ is the smallest number s.t. $a^r-1\\equiv0~(mod~N)$, so $a^{r/2}-1$ does not satisfy the equivalence. Step 4, also garantees $x+1\\not\\equiv0~(mod~N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have that neither $x-1$ nor $x+1$ is divisible by $N=pq$, but their product $(x-1)(x+1)$ is. Since $N$ has just two prime factors, $p$ must divide $x-1$ or $x+1$ and $q$ the other term."
