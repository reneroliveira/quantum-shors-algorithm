    "\n",
    "But in most cases we'll choose a number in $G_N$. Step 2 finds the order $r$ of $a$ in $G_N$.\n",

    "At first, consider $N$ being an odd prime number (because even primes won't appear in encryption applications). We'll have $|G_N|=\\varphi(N)=N-1$, an even number, so consider $2^d$ the large power of 2 diving $N-1$. As said before, it can be show that $G_N$ is a cyclic group under modulo $N$ multiplication.

So, the probability of a random number in $G_N$ have an order divisible by $2^d$ is 1/2 (because $t$ is equaly likely to be odd or even).\n",
